# ![logo](icon.png) ha-sip (Kotlin/JVM port)

This is a from-scratch **Kotlin/JVM reimplementation** of [arnonym/ha-plugins](https://github.com/arnonym/ha-plugins)'
`ha-sip` add-on — a Home Assistant SIP/VoIP gateway. It runs on the JVM against PJSIP's
Java SWIG bindings instead of Python's `pjsua2` bindings, but the external contract is
kept intentionally **byte-compatible** with the Python original: the same `.env`/add-on
option names, the same stdin/MQTT command JSON, the same outbound webhook JSON payloads,
the same `incoming_call_file` menu YAML schema, and the same sensor entity IDs. Existing
automations, `incoming.yaml` files, and add-on configs written for the Python version are
expected to keep working unmodified against this port.

### Home Assistant SIP/VoIP Gateway is a Home Assistant app which
- allows the dialing and hanging up of phone numbers through a SIP end-point
- triggering of services through dial tones (DTMF) after the call was established.
- listens for incoming calls and can trigger actions through a web-hook (the call is not picked up)
- accepting calls (optionally filtered by number)
- handle PIN input before triggering actions
- send DTMF digits to an established call (incoming or outgoing)
- record calls into .wav files
- [speak to Home Assistant Voice Assist without special hardware](VOICE-ASSISTANT.md)

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add app repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farnonym%2Fha-plugins-kt)

This app is for the Home Assistant OS or supervised installation methods mentioned in
https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/. With that in place you can install this third-party plug-in like described in
https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os#installing-a-third-party-app-repository. The repository URL is
`https://github.com/arnonym/ha-plugins-kt`.

> **Note:**
> This add-on's slug is `ha-sip-kt` (distinct from the production `ha-sip` add-on), so it
> can be installed side by side with the Python version for comparison. If you enable both
> at once, make sure they don't share the same SIP account/port. See
> [Testing this Kotlin port in Home Assistant](#testing-this-kotlin-port-in-home-assistant).

> **Note:**
> Alternatively you can run ha-sip in a stand-alone mode (for Home Assistant Container installations).
> In that mode the communication to ha-sip will be handled by MQTT. You can find the installation steps at
> the end of this document.

After that you need to configure your SIP account(s), TTS parameters and webhook ID. The default configuration looks like this:

```yaml
sip_global:
    port: 5060
    log_level: 5 # log level of pjsip library
    name_server: '' # comma separated list of name servers, must be set if sip server must be resolved via SRV record
    cache_dir: '/config/audio_cache' # directory to cache TTS messages or converted audio files. Must be inside /config or /media and existing
    global_options: ''
sip:
    enabled: true
    registrar_uri: sip:fritz.box
    id_uri: sip:homeassistant@fritz.box
    realm: '*'
    user_name: homeassistant
    password: secure
    answer_mode: listen  # "listen", "accept", or "reject". see below
    settle_time: 1 # time to wait for playing the message/actions/etc. after call was established
    incoming_call_file: "" # config and menu definition file for incoming calls, see below
    options: ''
sip_2:
    enabled: false
    registrar_uri: sip:fritz.box
    id_uri: sip:anotheruser@fritz.box
    realm: '*'
    user_name: anotheruser
    password: secret
    answer_mode: listen
    settle_time: 1
    incoming_call_file: ""
    options: ''
tts:
    engine_id: tts.google_translate_de_com # entity id of the TTS engine
    platform: google_translate # deprecated, must not be set if engine_id is set
    language: en # might also be in en-US format, depending on the platform
    debug_print: false # set to true, to output known engines and languages to the log at startup
    voice: zephyr # voice if engine supports it
webhook:
    id: sip_call_webhook_id
```

> **Note:**
> When your `user_name` or `password` starts with a number, you need to put it in quotes like `"1234"`.

> **Note**
> For TTS you need to install one of the [TTS integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech).
> If you're unsure about the entity id used for `engine_id`, set `debug_print` to `true` and restart the app.
> The app will output a list of all available engines and languages into the log. If the configured engine and language
> is valid, it will also log the available voices (if the engine supports it).

> **Note**
> You are able to access the /config and /media directory inside the app for config files, audio files, cache and recordings.

## Usage

> **Note:**
> All examples below use `YOUR_ADDON_SLUG` as a placeholder for the `addon:` field. Look
> up the real value in Home Assistant under Settings → Add-ons → ha-sip (Kotlin) →
> Info, or Developer Tools → Actions (search for `hassio.addon_stdin` and check the
> `addon` field's autocomplete) — it's a `<repository_hash>_ha-sip-kt` style id assigned
> by Supervisor when it adds this repository, and can't be predicted ahead of time.

### Outgoing calls

Outgoing calls are made via the `hassio.addon_stdin` service in the action part of an automation.
To be able to enter the full command, you must switch to YAML mode by clicking on the menu with the triple dot and
selecting `Edit in YAML`.

You can use `dial` and `hangup` with the `hassio.addon_stdin` service to control outgoing calls in an action in
your automation:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: dial
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box # number to call. Format depends on your SIP provider,
                                    # but might look like 'sip:+49123456789@fritz.box' for external calls
        webhook_to_call: # web-hook IDs which you can listen on in your actions (additional to the global web-hook)
            ring_timeout: another_webhook_id # can be all the same, or different
            call_established: another_webhook_id
            entered_menu: another_webhook_id
            timeout: another_webhook_id  # is called after the given time-out on a menu is reached
            dtmf_digit: another_webhook_id # is called when the calling party sends a DTMF tone
            call_disconnected: another_webhook_id
            playback_done: another_webhook_id # is called after playback of message or audio file is done
        ring_timeout: 15 # time to ring in seconds (optional, defaults to 300)
        sip_account: 1 # number of configured sip account: 1, 2, or 3
                       # (optional, defaults to first enabled sip account)
        menu:
            message: There's a burglar in da house.
```

If there is already an outgoing call to the same number active, the request will be ignored.

#### To hang up the call again:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: hangup
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        sip_code: 486 # optional SIP status code (e.g. 486 "Busy Here", 603 "Decline")
                      # only applied when the call has not been answered yet;
                      # ignored for already active calls
```

#### To send DTMF digits to an established call:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: send_dtmf
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        digits: "123#"
        method: in_band # method can be "in_band" (default), "rfc2833" or "sip_info"
```

> **Note:**
> When using a `#` digit, you need to put the whole sequence in quotes, eg. `"#5"`.

> **Warning**
> You can't use the `post_action` with `send_dtmf` because there's no way to know when PJSIP is done sending the tones.

#### To transfer a call to a different SIP URI:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: transfer
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        transfer_to: sip:**623@fritz.box
```

#### To bridge the audio streams of two active calls:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: bridge_audio
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        bridge_to: sip:**623@fritz.box
```

#### To play a message through TTS

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: play_message
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        message: hello!
        tts_language: en
        cache_audio: true # If message should be cached in `cache_dir`.
                          # Defaults to false. `cache_dir` must be configured in ha-sip config.
                          # Don't enable this for dynamic messages, you'll just fill your storage.
        wait_for_audio_to_finish: true # Do not accept DTMF tones until the message has been played
        post_action: hangup # hang up the call after the message has been played, only "noop" (default)
                            # and "hangup" are supported in this context
```

#### To play an audio file

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: play_audio_file
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        audio_file: '/config/audio/welcome.mp3'
        cache_audio: true # If converted file should be cached in `cache_dir`.
                          # Defaults to false. `cache_dir` must be configured in ha-sip config
        wait_for_audio_to_finish: true # Do not accept DTMF tones until the audio file has been played
        post_action: hangup # hang up the call after the message has been played, only "noop" (default)
        # and "hangup" are supported in this context
```

#### To stop audio playback (both audio file and message):

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: stop_playback
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
```

#### To start a call recording

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: start_recording
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        recording_file: "/config/www/call_12345.wav" # must be an absolute path
```

> **Note:**
> The recording is stopped when the call ends.

#### To stop a call recording

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: stop_recording
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
```

### Incoming calls

#### Listen mode

In `listen` mode no call will be answered (picked up) but you can trigger an automation through a [Webhook trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger) for every incoming call.
The webhook ID must match the ID set in the configuration.

You can get the remote from `{{trigger.json.remote_uri}}` or `{{trigger.json.parsed_remote_uri}}` for usage in e.g. the action of your automation.
If you want to react on a webhook message with another command you should use `{{ trigger.json.internal_id }}` as the number.
If you also use the menu ID webhook you need to check for `{{ trigger.json.event == "incoming_call" }}` e.g. in a "Choose" action type.

Example of "incoming call" webhook message:

```json
{
    "event": "incoming_call",
    "call_direction": "incoming",
    "remote_uri": "<sip:5551234456@fritz.box>",
    "parsed_remote_uri": "5551234456",
    "sip_account": 1,
    "internal_id": "something-unique"
}
```

You can also answer an incoming call from home assistant by using the `hassio.addon_stdin` service:

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: answer
        number: "{{ trigger.json.internal_id }}" # if this is unclear, you can look that up in the logs ("Registering call with id <number>")
        webhook_to_call: # optional web-hook IDs which you can listen on in your actions (additional to the global web-hook)
            call_established: another_webhook_id
            entered_menu: another_webhook_id
            timeout: another_webhook_id  # is called after the given time-out on a menu is reached
            dtmf_digit: another_webhook_id # is called when the calling party sends a DTMF tone
            call_disconnected: another_webhook_id
            playback_done: another_webhook_id # is called after playback of message or audio file is done
        menu:
          message: Bye
          post_action: hangup
```

If you don't provide a menu the menu from `incoming_call_file` will be used.

#### Accept mode

In `accept` mode you can additionally make ha-sip to accept the call. For this you can define a menu per SIP account. Put a config file
into your `/config` directory of your home-assistant installation (e.g. use the samba app to access that directory).

Example content of `/config/sip-1-incoming.yaml`:

```yaml
allowed_numbers: # list of numbers which will be answered. If removed all numbers will be accepted
    - "5551234456"
    - "5559876543"
    - "555{*}" # matches every number starting with 555
    - "555{?}" # matches every number starting with 555 which is 4 digits long
# blocked_numbers: # alternatively you can specify the numbers not to be answered. You can't have both.
#    - "5551234456"
#    - "5559876543"
answer_after: 0 # time in seconds after the call is answered (optional, defaults to 0)
webhook_to_call: # web-hook IDs which you can listen on in your actions (additional to the global web-hook)
    call_established: another_webhook_id # can be all the same, or different
    entered_menu: another_webhook_id
    dtmf_digit: another_webhook_id
    call_disconnected: another_webhook_id
menu:
    message: Please enter your access code
    choices_are_pin: true
    choices:
        '1234':
            id: owner
            message: Welcome beautiful.
            post_action: hangup
        '5432':
            id: maintenance
            message: Your entrance has been logged.
            post_action: hangup
        'default':
            id: wrong_code
            message: Wrong code, please try again
            post_action: return
```

After that you set `incoming_call_file` in the app configuration to `/config/sip-1-incoming.yaml`.

#### Reject mode

In `reject` mode every incoming call is automatically rejected. No audio is played and the call is never
answered. A webhook is still triggered for each rejected call, so you can still react to incoming calls
in your automations (e.g. for logging or notifications).

The SIP response code sent to the caller defaults to `603 Decline` and can be changed via the
`--reject-sip-code` option on the SIP account (e.g. `--reject-sip-code 486` for "Busy Here").

## Call menu definition

used for incoming and outgoing calls.

```yaml
menu:
    id: main # If "id" is present, a message will be sent via webhook (entered_menu), see below (optional)
    message: Please enter your access code # the message to be played via TTS (optional, defaults to empty)
    language: en # TTS language (optional, defaults to the global language from app config)
    choices_are_pin: true # If the choices should be handled like PINs (optional, defaults to false)
    timeout: 10 # time in seconds before "timeout" choice is triggered (optional, defaults to 300)
    post_action: noop # this action will be triggered after the message was played. Can be
                      # "noop" (do nothing),
                      # "return <level>" (makes only sense in a sub-menu, returns <level> levels, defaults to 1),
                      # "hangup" (hang-up the call) and
                      # "repeat_message" (repeat the message until the time-out is reached)
                      # "jump <menu-id>" (jumps to menu with id <menu-id>)
                      # (optional, defaults to noop)

            id: wrong_code
            message: Wrong code, please try again
            post_action: return
        'timeout': # this will be triggered when there is no input
            id: timeout
            message: Bye.
            post_action: hangup
```

> **Note:**
> The audio files need to reside in your home-assistant `config` or `media` directory, as these are the only directory accessible inside the app.

## Web-hooks

For most events in ha-sip there's a web-hook triggered. The property `internal_id` is the number you can use
to identify the call in your automations.

These are the common fields available in all webhook events:

```json
{
    "internal_id": "something-unique",
    "call_direction": "incoming",
    "local_uri": "<sip:sip-user@fritz.box>",
    "remote_uri": "<sip:5551234456@fritz.box>",
    "parsed_local_uri": "sip-user",
    "parsed_remote_uri": "5551234456",
    "sip_account": 1,
    "call_id": "7490FE75C2CB1D45@192.168.178.1",
    "headers": {}
}
```

`call_direction` is either `"incoming"` or `"outgoing"`.

> **Note:** The `headers` field contains extracted SIP headers if `--extract-headers` is configured on the SIP account,
> otherwise it's an empty object. See [SIP Header Extraction](#sip-header-extraction) for more details.

Additionally, the event name and event specific fields are available:

### `incoming_call`

```json
{
    "event": "incoming_call"
}
```

### `call_established`

```json
{
    "event": "call_established"
}
```

### `entered_menu`

```json
{
    "event": "entered_menu",
    "menu_id": "owner"
}
```

### `dtmf_digit`

```json
{
    "event": "dtmf_digit",
    "digit": "1"
}
```

### `call_disconnected`

```json
{
    "event": "call_disconnected"
}
```

### `playback_done` for message (TTS)

```json
{
    "event": "playback_done",
    "type": "message",
    "message": "message that has been played"
}
```

### `playback_done` for audio file

```json
{
    "event": "playback_done",
    "type": "audio_file",
    "audio_file": "/media/audio/welcome.mp3"
}
```

### `ring_timeout`

```json
{
    "event": "ring_timeout"
}
```

### `timeout`

```json
{
    "event": "timeout",
    "menu_id": "main"
}
```

### `recording_started`

```json
{
    "event": "recording_started",
    "recording_file": "/media/www/call_12345.wav"
}
```

### `recording_stopped`

```json
{
    "event": "recording_stopped",
    "recording_file": "/config/www/call_12345.wav"
}
```

### `outgoing_call_initiated`

```json
{
    "event": "outgoing_call_initiated"
}
```

## Sensors

ha-sip can expose sensor entities to Home Assistant for monitoring SIP account status and call activity.
These only show information regarding ha-sip itself, not the SIP provider (you cannot see calls that are
answered on other SIP devices, as this is not supported by the SIP protocol).

To enable sensors, add the following to your app configuration:

```yaml
sensors:
    enabled: true
    entity_prefix: ha_sip  # optional, defaults to "ha_sip"
```

### Call Activity Sensor

Tracks whether a call is currently active on each SIP account.

| Entity ID | State | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sensor.{prefix}_account_{n}` | `true` / `false` | Whether a call is active |

**Attributes when active:**
- `remote_uri`: Full remote party URI
- `local_uri`: Full local SIP account URI
- `parsed_remote_uri`: Extracted remote party number
- `parsed_local_uri`: Extracted local SIP account number
- `sip_account`: Account number
- `call_id`: SIP call ID
- `headers`: Extracted SIP headers (if configured)

### Registration Status Sensor

Monitors the SIP registration state for each account. Useful for alerting when your SIP connection drops.

| Entity ID | State | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sensor.{prefix}_registration_{n}` | `registered` / `unregistered` / `failed` / `unknown` | Registration state |

**Attributes:**
- `status_code`: SIP status code (200 = registered)
- `reason`: Status reason text
- `last_change`: ISO timestamp of last state change

**Icons:**
- `mdi:phone-check` - Registered
- `mdi:phone-off` - Unregistered
- `mdi:phone-alert` - Failed
- `mdi:phone-clock` - Unknown (initial state)

### Last Call Sensor

Tracks information about the most recent call on each account.

| Entity ID | State | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sensor.{prefix}_last_call_{n}` | `incoming` / `outgoing` / `none` | Direction of last call |

**Attributes:**
- `remote_uri`: Full remote party URI
- `local_uri`: Full local SIP account URI
- `parsed_remote_uri`: Extracted remote party number
- `parsed_local_uri`: Extracted local SIP account number
- `call_id`: SIP call ID
- `timestamp`: ISO timestamp when call ended

**Icons:**
- `mdi:phone-incoming` - Incoming call
- `mdi:phone-outgoing` - Outgoing call
- `mdi:phone` - No calls yet

### Example Automations

Alert when SIP registration fails:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "SIP Registration Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.ha_sip_registration_1
        to: "failed"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "SIP account 1 registration failed!"
```

Log last call:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Log Incoming Calls"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.ha_sip_last_call_1
        to: "incoming"
    action:
      - service: logbook.log
        data:
          name: "Incoming Call"
          message: "Call from {{ state_attr('sensor.ha_sip_last_call_1', 'parsed_remote_uri') }}"
```

## SIP Header Extraction

You can extract specific SIP headers from incoming and outgoing calls and include them in all webhook events. This is useful for accessing custom headers like `X-Caller-ID`, `P-Asserted-Identity`, or any other SIP header your provider sends.

To configure header extraction, add the `--extract-headers` option to your SIP account:

```yaml
sip:
    enabled: true
    registrar_uri: sip:provider.com
    # ... other settings ...
    options: '--extract-headers X-Caller-ID,P-Asserted-Identity'
```

The extracted headers will be included in all webhook events for calls on that account:

```json
{
    "event": "incoming_call",
    "call_direction": "incoming",
    "remote_uri": "<sip:5551234456@provider.com>",
    "parsed_remote_uri": "5551234456",
    "sip_account": 1,
    "headers": {
        "X-Caller-ID": "John Doe",
        "P-Asserted-Identity": "<sip:+15551234456@provider.com>"
    }
}
```

Headers that are not present in the SIP message will have a `null` value. Header name matching is case-insensitive.

To discover which headers are available, enable `--debug-headers` in `global_options`:

```yaml
sip_global:
    global_options: '--debug-headers enabled'
```

This will log all SIP headers for each incoming and outgoing call to help you identify which headers to extract.

## Examples

#### Trigger services through DTMF on an outgoing call

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: dial
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        menu:
            message: Press one to open the door, two to turn on light outside, three to play music
            choices:
                '1':
                    message: Door has been opened
                    action:
                        domain: switch
                        service: turn_on
                        entity_id: switch.open_front_door
                '2':
                    message: Light outside has been switched on
                    action:
                        domain: light
                        service: turn_on
                        entity_id: light.outside
                '3':
                    message: Play music
                    action:
                        domain: script
                        service: turn_on
                        entity_id: script.play_music_please
                        service_data:
                          variables:
                            song: 'Never gonna give you up'
```

#### Play a message without DTMF interaction on sip account 1

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: dial
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        ring_timeout: 15
        sip_account: 1
    menu:
        message: There's a burglar in da house.
```

#### Use PIN protection on outgoing call

```yaml
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
    addon: YOUR_ADDON_SLUG
    input:
        command: dial
        number: sip:**620@fritz.box
        menu:
            message: Please enter your access code
            choices_are_pin: true
            timeout: 10
            choices:
                '1234':
                    id: owner
                    message: Welcome beautiful.
                    post_action: hangup
                '5432':
                    id: maintenance
                    message: Your entrance has been logged.
                    post_action: hangup
                'default':
                    id: wrong_code
                    message: Wrong code, please try again
                    post_action: return
                'timeout':
                    id: timeout
                    message: Bye.
                    post_action: hangup
```

All the examples are working also for incoming calls when you copy the `menu` part into your incoming configuration yaml.

## Troubleshooting

The first place to look is the log of the ha-sip app. There you can see individual SIP messages and the logs of
ha-sip itself (prefixed with "|").

## Stand-alone mode

The stand-alone mode can be used if you run home assistant in a docker environment and you don't have access to the hassio.addon_stdin service.
Instead of stdin - MQTT will be used for communication.

1. `docker-compose.yaml` already includes a `mosquitto` broker (config in
   `mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`), published to `127.0.0.1:1883` on the Docker
   host and reachable from `ha-sip` there too (it runs with `network_mode:
   host`). Point Home Assistant's [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)
   at that same broker/port so it can publish to and read from the topics
   below. If you'd rather use your own broker instead, remove the
   `mosquitto` service from `docker-compose.yaml` and point step 3 below at
   it instead.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the variable place-holders with your real configuration.
3. In your `.env` file, enable MQTT through `GLOBAL_OPTIONS` and point it at your broker, for example:

   ```
   GLOBAL_OPTIONS="--enable-mqtt --mqtt-address 127.0.0.1 --mqtt-port 1883 --mqtt-topic hasip/execute --mqtt-state-topic hasip/state"
   ```

   (add `--mqtt-username`/`--mqtt-password` if your broker requires
   authentication -- the bundled `mosquitto` service allows anonymous
   connections since it's only published to localhost)
4. Install [docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository)
5. Run `docker compose up -d` in the main folder of the application to run the ha-sip service
6. Now you can use the `mqtt.publish` service in home assistant to send commands as json to the topic configured in `--mqtt-topic` (defaults to `hasip/execute`) from your automations

   Example:
   ```yaml
    service: mqtt.publish
    data:
        payload: >-
            { "command": "dial", "number": "sip:**620@fritz.box", "menu": { "message": "Hello from ha-sip.", "language": "en" } }
        topic: hasip/execute
    ```

7. You can listen to call state events on the topic configured in `--mqtt-state-topic` (defaults to `hasip/state`).

## Testing this Kotlin port in Home Assistant

There are two ways to get this build running against a real Home Assistant instance:

### Option A — install via the add-on store (uses a pre-built image)

1. Add `https://github.com/arnonym/ha-plugins-kt` as a custom add-on repository (badge above), then install
   "ha-sip-kt" from the store.
2. Home Assistant Supervisor reads `ha-sip/config.json`'s `image` field
   (`ghcr.io/arnonym/{arch}-ha-sip-kt`) and **pulls that pre-built image from the GitHub
   Container Registry instead of building from source** — this is standard Supervisor
   behavior for any add-on that declares an `image`. That means the image must already
   have been built and pushed by [`.github/workflows/build-amd64.yml`](.github/workflows/build-amd64.yml) /
   [`build-aarch64.yml`](.github/workflows/build-aarch64.yml) for the tag matching
   `config.json`'s `version` (currently `5.6`) before installing this way. Those
   workflows authenticate to `ghcr.io` with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (via the job's
   `packages: write` permission), so **no registry secret has to be configured**. They
   push images on `main` (see [Beta channel](#beta-channel-the-next-repository) for the
   `next` branch) or via manual `workflow_dispatch`. The image name is read from
   `config.json`'s `image` field rather than hard-coded, which is what lets the beta
   mirror reuse the same two workflow files.
3. These test images live under `ghcr.io/arnonym/{arch}-ha-sip-kt` — completely separate
   from the production `agellhaus/{arch}-ha-sip` Docker Hub images used by the Python
   add-on, so testing this port can never overwrite what existing users are running.

> **Note:**
> A GHCR package is **private** when it is first created, and Supervisor pulls
> anonymously. After the very first successful push of a new image name, open the
> package under https://github.com/users/arnonym/packages, then *Package settings →
> Change visibility → Public* (once per package, i.e. per architecture and per channel).
> Installing while the package is private fails with a manifest/authentication error.

### Option B — local add-on (Supervisor builds from source on your machine)

If you'd rather Supervisor build the image itself from this checkout (no registry push
required, and you always get exactly what's in your working tree):

1. Copy (or symlink) the `ha-sip/` directory into Home Assistant's `/addons/local/`
   folder (e.g. via the Samba or SSH/Terminal add-on) — as `/addons/local/ha-sip-kt`.
2. Remove the `"image": "ghcr.io/arnonym/{arch}-ha-sip-kt",` line from the copy's
   `config.json`. As long as `image` is set, Supervisor always pulls from the registry
   instead of building — removing it is what makes Supervisor build locally from the
   `Dockerfile` in that folder instead.
3. In the Supervisor add-on store, find "ha-sip-kt" under "Local add-ons" and install
   it — this triggers an on-device build (multi-stage: pjproject + Java SWIG bindings,
   then the Kotlin app, then the runtime image), which will take a while the first
   time.

Either way, once installed you configure it exactly like described above in
[Installation](#installation) — same options schema as the Python add-on.

## Beta channel (the `next` repository)

Like the Python add-on's `ha-plugins-next`, this port has a second add-on repository for
beta testing: [`https://github.com/arnonym/ha-plugins-kt-next`](https://github.com/arnonym/ha-plugins-kt-next).
It carries the add-on slug `ha-sip-kt-next` and the images `ghcr.io/arnonym/{arch}-ha-sip-kt-next`,
so testers can install it **alongside** the regular (non-beta) add-on — just don't run both
against the same SIP account/port at once.

**For testers:** add that repository URL in Home Assistant exactly like in
[Installation](#installation) and install "ha-sip-kt-next".

**For releasing a beta:** work happens on the `next` branch here; the beta repository is
not edited by hand. Push `next`, then run:

```bash
mise run update-next-repo          # keep the version from ha-sip/config.json
mise run update-next-repo 5.7-beta1  # or override it for this beta
```

The task clones the `next` branch into `~/tmp/ha-plugins-kt-next`, rewrites the add-on
identity for the beta channel — `repository.json` (name, URL), `ha-sip/config.json` (name,
slug, URL, description, `image`, optionally `version`) and the repo/slug/image names in
`README.md` and `ha-sip/CHANGELOG.md` — commits, and **force-pushes** to the beta
repository's `next` branch. Anything committed there directly is overwritten on the next
run.

Both build workflows are copied along and run in the beta repository too. They publish
images from `main` here and from `next` in the mirror, taking the image name from
`config.json`'s `image` — which is why no separate workflow file is needed for the beta.
Because they push to `ghcr.io` with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the beta repository needs
no secrets of its own; its first build does need the two new `-ha-sip-kt-next` packages
[switched to public](#option-a--install-via-the-add-on-store-uses-a-pre-built-image),
though.

The only other setup is push access over SSH (the task switches the remote to
`git@github.com:...` before pushing). The defaults can be overridden with the `REPO_URL`,
`NEXT_REPO_URL`, `NEXT_REPO_SSH` and `TMP_DIR` environment variables.

## Development

This is a Gradle (Kotlin DSL) multi-module project — `:core` (pure Kotlin, no pjsip
dependency, host-testable) and `:app` (depends on `:core` plus the PJSIP Java SWIG
bindings).

1. Get pjsip's Java SWIG bindings (`pjsua2.jar` + `libpjsua2.so`), either:
   - `mise run extract-bindings:docker` (or `./gradlew :app:extractPjsua2Bindings`) —
     builds the `pjsip-bindings` stage of `ha-sip/Dockerfile` in a container and copies
     the artifacts out (needs Docker/Podman), or
   - `mise run extract-bindings` (`scripts/build-pjsua2-bindings-native.sh`) — builds
     pjproject + the Java SWIG module directly on the host into an isolated `deps/`
     prefix (needs `gcc`/`swig`/`libssl-dev`/`libopus-dev` installed locally, no
     Docker/Podman involved).
2. `mise install` — installs the pinned JDK (Temurin 21, matching the shipped runtime,
   see `mise.toml`).
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders with your real
   configuration (`HA_BASE_URL` is something like `http://homeassistant.local:8123/api`;
   the access token is created from `http://homeassistant.local:8123/profile`).
4. `mise run test` (or `./gradlew :core:test` from `ha-sip/`) — runs the `:core` test
   suite, no Docker/pjsip involvement at all.
5. `mise run build` (or `./gradlew build` from `ha-sip/`) — full build including `:app`.
6. `mise run run` — runs the built jar locally with the correct
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`-Djava.library.path` set automatically.
7. Paste commands as JSON (without line-breaks) into stdin of the running app:

   Example:
   ```json
   { "command": "dial", "number": "sip:**620@fritz.box", "menu": { "message": "Hello from ha-sip.", "language": "en" } }
   ```
